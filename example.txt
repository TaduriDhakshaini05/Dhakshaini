Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time.
 It allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project simultaneously without conflicts. 
Git provides tools to manage branches, merge changes, and revert to previous versions.
It's widely used in software development to maintain the integrity and history of code.
Git is open-source and supports workflows for both small projects and large-scale collaborative efforts.
